            <p class="about-p"> Andy Mo is my name and Software Engineering is my game. I am a curious mind with a willingness to learn about anything and everything that interests me.
                I aspire to create or be apart of something that will leave its fingerprint on this world. Other than coding, I enjoy playing basketball, hanging out with my friends, and 
                being around my loved ones.

            <h2 class="project-one-header">Project Skynet</h2>
            <p>This is the very first project I did with a partner at my software engineering course,e General Assembly. We made a personal assistant app that uses voice detection to help you with certain task throughout your daily activies such as reminders.  our app wor For this project,
                I mainly worked in the backend back of the development process. This was my first experience working with express and mongoose. HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used on this project as well.

            <h2 class="project-one-header">Wayfarer</h2>
            <p> Unlike my other projects, we had to follow a strict way of doing this project to simulate what is like
                having a client. Our instructors gave us a set wireframe of how they wanted it to look and what technologies were needed. We were then to try to implement as many features as possbile. In this project, I used React, Express, Mongoose, HTML, and CSS on this project.
